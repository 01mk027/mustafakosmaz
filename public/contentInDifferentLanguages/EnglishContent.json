The analysis can be analyzed in two parts. The first part consists of structuring the particles in the decay channel and recording the values of the variables to be used in classification. The second part consists of choosing the optimum method to be used in the classification and calculating the coefficients of the values to be used in the classification. Signal improvement is performed after classification. Classification was made with the help of TMVA (Toolkit For Multivariate Analysis) running within the ROOT data analysis framework. The Boosted Decision Tree method was used as the optimum classification (artificial neural network) method."
